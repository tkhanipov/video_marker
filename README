INTRODUCTION
============

video_marker is a simple linear video markup tool which can be used to mark video 
intervals with certain attributes (values, labels, comments). It was developed 
as an internal tool to markup vehicles for automatic testing of a Vision-based 
industrial Automatic Vehicle Classifier. Features related only to vehicle 
classifier have been removed and the code has been released to open source.

This tool has the following features:
  - two frame jump modes with adjustable steps;
  - two speed playback with adjustable speeds;
  - automatic markup loading;
  - specifying video and markup from command line;
  - commenting intervals;
  - labeling intervals;
  - navigation between intervals;
  - scrolling to video position;
  - dumping intervals to directories as set of images;
  - gamma correction;
  - creating screenshots.

Full set of features is available through its main menu.

The very initial version of this program was based on a simple wxWidgets tool
for region merging algorithm improvements in a problem of color image segmentation
which was used for the university thesis. A lot of code in this tool seems bulky
and immature. Feel free to improve it!



WINDOWS BUILD
======= =====

Windows build was tested on a machine running Windows 7 with the MS Visual Studio 9 2008 compiler.

1. Install the latest cmake from http://www.cmake.org.

2. Download and build wxWidgets 2.8:
   - download https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.8.12/wxMSW-2.8.12-Setup.exe
   - run the file and install wxWidgets sources
   - build wxWidgets with MS Visual Studio 9 2008 from build/msw/wx.dsp using appropriate configuration.
     DO NOT enable unicode support

2. Build video_marker:
   cd path/to/video_marker
   mkdir build.vc9
   cd build.vc9
   cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"

   If error occurs saying that wxWidgets was not found specify path to wxWidgets installation dir manually:
   cmake .. -DwxWidgets_ROOT_DIR=path/to/wxWidgets -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"

   Open video_marker.sln and build.

3. Run video_marker from bin/win32.



LINUX BUILD
===== =====

Linux build was tested on a x86_64 machine running freshly installed Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.1.
Out of the box it has gcc 4.8.2.
In the following instructions it is presumed that a similar machine is used.

1. Install additional packages:
   sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake yasm.

2. Build and install wxWidgets 2.8 without unicode support:
   wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.8.12/wxWidgets-2.8.12.tar.gz
   tar xzf wxWidgets-2.8.12.tar.gz
   cd wxWidgets-2.8.12
   mkdir build-gtk
   cd build-gtk
   ../configure --disable-unicode
   make
   sudo make install

3. Build ffmpeg libraries:
   cd path/to/video_marker/ffmpeg
   tar xjf ffmpeg-r26400-swscale-r32676.tar.bz2
   cd ffmpeg-r26400-swscale-r32676
   patch -p4 < ../gst-ffmpeg-0.10.13-gcc-4.7-1.patch
   ./configure \
     --enable-gpl \
     --enable-version3 \
     --enable-runtime-cpudetect \
     --enable-memalign-hack \
     --enable-shared \
     --disable-static
   make
   sudo make install

4. Build video_marker:
   cd path/to/video_marker
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

5. Run video_marker from bin/linux64
