This is a special ffmpeg version used to build video_marker.

Windows headers and pre-built binaries are already added to the repository, while Linux stuff must be built manually.

Under Linux you need to do the following:

1. Unpack archive.
2. Go to unpacked archive root directory.
3. Apply patch using command
   patch -p4 < PATH/TO/gst-ffmpeg-0.10.13-gcc-4.7-1.patch
4. Run configure:
   ./configure \
     --enable-gpl \
     --enable-version3 \
     --enable-runtime-cpudetect \
     --enable-memalign-hack \
     --enable-shared \
     --disable-static
5. Run make
6. Run sudo make install
